### Description

The bot parses junior vacancies by the main programming languages, referring to the selected recruiting platform, and displays the statistics in a convenient form for the selected language. 
You can output the number of jobs right now, or choose the type of comparison - for a week, a month, 3 months, 6 months, a year, and understand the dynamics of job growth and the general idea of what is happening with the IT industry.

<font size = 1>*since the bot is little more than a month old, the actual comparison is only available for a month. If you select a longer period, the comparison for a month will be shown</font>
